## Description
A  **flight delay**  is when an airline flight takes off and/or lands later than its scheduled time. The  [Federal Aviation Administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration "Federal Aviation Administration")  (FAA) considers a flight to be delayed when it is 15 minutes later than its scheduled time. A  **cancellation**  occurs when the airline does not operate the flight at all for a certain reason.

In the  [European Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union "European Union"),  [Flight Compensation Regulation 261/2004](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_Compensation_Regulation_261/2004 "Flight Compensation Regulation 261/2004")  states that flight delays for over three hours, cancellations and denied boarding entitles passengers to a compensation from €250 up to €600 per passenger from the airline.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_cancellation_and_delay#cite_note-1)

This repository elaborates how we could predict flight delays using ML.
